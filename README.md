# todo-list
This todo-list project allows you to add your tasks in a list. 
It keeps them in the local storage so if you close the page and open it again you can still see them.
You can also delete the tasks one by one or clear them all at once.
And there is also a filter input so you can search your tasks.

Have fun.
